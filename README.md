# 🌱 Automatic Water Sprinkling Machine using Smart Irrigation System  

Maintaining a healthy garden, backyard, or agricultural field requires consistent and efficient watering. Traditional manual watering can be time-consuming, labour-intensive, and inefficient. This project introduces a **Smart Irrigation System** that automates watering using real-time soil conditions, ensuring **optimal water usage** and **enhanced plant health**.

## 🌍 Introduction  
Overwatering leads to **wastage and root rot**, while underwatering causes **plant stress and poor growth**. The **Automatic Water Sprinkling Machine** leverages **soil moisture sensors** and a **microcontroller (Arduino)** to maintain soil health by regulating water supply precisely when required.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Automate the irrigation process using soil moisture feedback.  
- Prevent water wastage and ensure optimal hydration.  
- Minimize human intervention in plant watering.  
- Enhance plant growth and sustainability.

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Soil Monitoring:**  
   - A **Soil Moisture Sensor** continuously measures the soil’s water content.  
   - Data is transmitted to an **Arduino microcontroller**.  

2. **Decision Making:**  
   - When soil moisture falls below a predefined threshold, the system **activates the water pump**.  
   - Once optimal moisture is restored, the pump automatically stops.  

3. **Water Sprinkling:**  
   - Water is distributed via sprinklers or drip irrigation depending on field requirements.  

4. **Environmental Factors (Enhanced Model):**  
   - **Temperature and humidity sensors** adjust watering frequency based on weather conditions.
